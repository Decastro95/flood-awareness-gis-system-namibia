LOADING NOTICE:
This is a large raster file (108MB) that may take time to load in the browser preview.
For web applications, consider:
1. Converting to smaller tile format
2. Using cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG)
3. Creating pyramid levels for different zoom scales

USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use server-side processing for elevation queries
- Implement tile-based serving for web maps
- Consider MapBox Terrain API as alternative
- Extract elevation profiles for specific areas only
